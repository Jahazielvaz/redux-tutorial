REDUX STEPS

1- Adding Dependencies: npm install react-redux redux
2- Import { createStore }: Import it in index.js (I still don't know why we have to import it here, but once I learn exactly what it does, I'll know.)
3- Create a reducer function:
    EXAMPLE:
      function reducer(){
        return 'State';
      }
4- Create a store variable which contains the createStore(reducer) function.
    EXAMPLE:
      const store = createStore(reducer);
